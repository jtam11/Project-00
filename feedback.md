**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?  

Your code was complex and the gameplay was well thought out.  I want to see some OOP integration to make your code more modular.  The necessity for code to be written twice (player 1 and player 2) was a bit painful but necessary in your case

**meets expectations**

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

Too creative! It took so long for me to finish!

**exceeds expectations**

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

You used best practices and good indentation and naming.  Modularity could be improved with OOP.  Great commenting.

**meets expectations**

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

You definitely solved some pretty hairy problems with your typing matching what is on the player sprite.  Great work!
